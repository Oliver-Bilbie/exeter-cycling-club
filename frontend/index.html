        Welcome to Exeter Cycling Club, bringing together people from Exeter and
        the surrounding area with a shared interest in group cycling. The best
        way to describe us is a 'cafe club'. We love cycling and we equally
        enjoy a social cafe stop, usually somewhere in the middle of the ride.
        The focus of the group is on developing the sociable element of cycling;
        having fun, getting to know people and supporting each other. We
        organise a weekly ride on Sunday of between 40-60 miles at an average
        pace of 16-18mph. Meeting up at Pinhoe Sainsbury's we start rides at
        7.30am (summer start time) so that we are back just after 11.00am and we
        always include a coffee stop en route. There is a strict no-drop policy,
        rides are at the pace of the slowest rider and we wait at the top of
        climbs for each other. We like to keep rides rolling, aim to keep stops
        to a minimum and get back in good time so that members can balance
        cycling with other family commitments. Please feel free to get in touch
        and come and join us, we are always eager to welcome new riders. We are
        not an official club, there is no committee, rides are arranged by the
        riders and there are no joining fees to pay.
