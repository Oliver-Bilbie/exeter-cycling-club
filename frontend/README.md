# Exeter Cycling Club UI

This directory contains the source code for the frontend of the Exeter Cycling Club web application.
The interface is written in Rust using the Yew framework.

This UI is designed to be rendered server-side, however it has intentionally been kept separate from the server logic for ease of development.

## Developer notes

To run a development environment, run
`trunk serve --open`
from this directory.
