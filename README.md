## Overview

Website for Exeter Cycling Club.
The web application allows users to authenticate using Strava's Oauth2. This allows club admins to create an upcoming ride based on a route from their Strava account. When a new route is set, members of the mailing list will be notified via email. These emails will give the member the option to confirm whether they are going to be coming on the ride - this attendance data is then sent to the club admins on the morning of the ride.
